    On this role I did system/architecture design. By given high-level product specifications my responsibilities were to ensure their feasibility, apply the best engineering practice and make the specifications technically concrete enough so that developers could implement them. Then, I would translate requirements into milestones and feature stories to make the developer's progress manageable.

    My responsibilities were to rebuild a huge (millions lines of code) product using Oracle to newSQL Cloud Spanner database that would give great horizontal scalability. While Cloud Spanner is indeed newSQL the transition from Oracle (and its dialect) was not trivial - there were certain technical challenges on the way including designing the ID sequence generators and working on tools to efficiently test the system on the high-load.

    This was probably my most "sciency" work of all. We were developing a tool(s) that would allow us to solve a problem of increasing test coverage of tens of millions lines of code. The tool would take code as an input and product unit tests. The challenge here is unmatched and you cannot simply go and Google the solution - no such tools existed back then and I think it is so to this day.

    The work included reading whitepapers and deep diving into intricacies of certain code generation algorithms.

    The first project I got in Constant was a C++ embedded system that once installed on a device tracks the position and movement of trucks. The system worked on a proprietary OS and was event based, i.e. whenever
    a truck makes a too risky u-turn the device would raise an event and send it to the server for the further analysis.

    The following projects were all about e-commerce. We were building websites for different automotive retail companies. The tech stack was primarily Java (Spring, JPA, JSF) with tiny bits of frontend development in Angular.

    That was my first job! I started during my university years as I was keen on programming embedded systems. What I really liked about this job is the immediate feedback whenever you upload your program to a device - you can physically light a led on a material device via writing something on a computer and it was groundbreaking for me.

    The products we did there are primarily focused on delivering certain data over GSM. For instance, there was a device that you can attach to a traffic light so that the police can control and monitor it online.
