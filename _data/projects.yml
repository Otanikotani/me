    Nowadays, social media influencers define what is fashion or trend. It is not magazines, it is not TV - it is people on the Internet. This is a new era of advertising and marketing. I am thrilled I work in SMM to enable creators to 
    live their dreams

    There is also that the people I work with on this project are the most intelligent I ever worked with before.

    Once created by the founder of Stackoverflow (Joel Spolsky - https://www.joelonsoftware.com/) Fogbugz was a 20 years old legacy product, which our team has rewritten to the modern cloud stack. I worked on a system design for the product creating models, defining functional requirements and milestones for developers
    to complete the rebuild in trackable and managed fashion.

    Most interestingly, this project gave me an opportunity to polish my Behaviour-Driven Development skills as we used BDD approach to define and verify functional requirements of the product.

    This is probably the most successful product I worked on. The product demo was presented on Google Cloud Next 2018.

    As a huge telecom (used by Vodafone) this product is extremely high-load. My responsibilities were to rewrite the backend of the system from unscalable Oracle DB to Google Cloud Spanner - newSQL horizontally scalable RDBMS.

    I strongly believe that my teammates in this product were the brightest people I ever known. I learnt a lot from them, especially when it came to deploying the product on Kubernetes.
